Image-Cryptography:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Description of the Program: This project can hide short text-messages by converting the text into a binary number and hiding this number in the last digits
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ of the RGB-values of the pixels in the image.
	                            Also, if the user has a picture with a hidden message, it encrypts the message and prints it in the command line.
	                            That way, every owner of that program has the possibility to send each other pictures with hidden messages and only people who also
	                            own that can read the message (of course it's not 100% secure, it's just a fun project).


	HOW TO GET STARTED:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Compiling: The compilation works on linux-based systems. To compile, libpng has to be installed.
	~~~~~~~~~~ Enter make to compile.

	Crypting: After compiling, you can crypt with the command
	~~~~~~~~~ ./crypt <source-picture-name>.png <new-picture-with-hidden-data>.png <file-with-message-to-crypt>
	          The <source-picture-name>.png has to exist already, the <new-picture-with-hidden-data>.png will be created by the program.
	          The new picture <new-picture-with-hidden-data>.png will seem equally to the source-picture, but secretly contains the message.

	Encrypting: After compiling, you can encrypt a picture you know it contains hidden information with the command
	~~~~~~~~~~~ ./encrypt <name-of-the-picture-with-hidden-data>.png
		    After executing the program, the decoded message will be printed to the screen.
